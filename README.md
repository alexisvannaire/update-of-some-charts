# Charts Update Repository

This repository is dedicated to providing updated versions of charts from various books, websites, and articles. Each chart is accompanied by a Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to get the corresponding data and generate the updated chart.

## Structure

Each source (book/website/article) has its own dedicated folder. Inside each folder, you will find:

- The original chart or a reference to it
- A Jupyter notebook with the code and instructions to update the chart
